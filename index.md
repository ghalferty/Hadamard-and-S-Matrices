# **Hello!**
This website serves as a library for examples of all known orders of Hadamard and S-matrices up to a certain value. It is not a fully exhaustive list. Here you will find: images of examples of certain orders of the matrices, links to the numerical matrix that respresents the specific shown image, and lastly, code files that were used to generate orders of these matrices.

# Hadamard Matrices

This website serves as a recurring library of examples of all known orders of Hadamard matrices. It does not list every inequivalent matrix. 

This library currently contains all known matrices up to order 768. It consists of every multiple of 4 except for 668 and 716, for which no known matrix is found.

## Order 1 Hadamard Matrix

# S-Matrices

This website serves as a recurring library of examples of all known orders of S-matrices. It does not list every inequivalent matrix.
